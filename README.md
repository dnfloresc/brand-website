# Brand-website

A template ecommerce website design with just HTML and CSS as a part of the course from PLatzi. 

Helped me to:
- Improve my basic skills on HTML and CSS.
- Learned how to make a project from the creation of the paper wireframe to the deploy.
- Learned how to link my website with Paypal to be able to use the pay section.
